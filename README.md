# lrm
## Lorem ipsum generation binary written in Rust

### Why?
* Browser plugins don't work the way I want (not enough control for length)
* I like re-inventing the wheel
* I wanted to brush up on my Rust skills (non-existant)

### Installation

### Usage

### Shout Outs
The actual lorem ipsum functionality comes from [lipsum](https://docs.rs/lipsum/0.6.0/lipsum/index.html)
